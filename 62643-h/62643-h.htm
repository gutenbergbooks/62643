<span class="i0">It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop sea<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the garden of Shut-Eye Town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Hurrah for that chocolate cat!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and peppermint canes,<br /></span>
